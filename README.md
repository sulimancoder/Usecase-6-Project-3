[Real Estate Analysis Project
üìä Project Overview
This project analyzes real estate data to uncover insights into the factors influencing property prices. It examines different sectors of the real estate market, including lands, apartments, and villas. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations between various factors and property prices, aiding data-driven decision-making in real estate investments.

The project also uses Streamlit for an interactive web application, which allows users to explore the data visually, filter by different property types, and view the impact of various features on property prices in real time.

üìÇ Data Sources
The project utilizes data from several sources:

Real Estate Data:
realEstate.csv: Contains general real estate information, such as property prices, area, and other attributes.
Riyadh_Aqqar.xlsx: Excel file with detailed data on various property types in Riyadh, including land, apartments, and villas.
RiyadhVillasAqar.csv: A CSV focused specifically on villa-related real estate data in Riyadh.
üîç Analysis & Methodology
In this project, we apply various data analysis techniques to gain insights into the Riyadh real estate market:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We clean and explore the data using libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to understand its structure and identify any missing or erroneous values.

Correlation Analysis: Using correlation matrices, we examine the relationships between features like area, price, and location, and how these affect property prices.

Data Visualization: We leverage libraries like seaborn and matplotlib to create insightful charts, including:

Bar plots
Heatmaps
Scatter plots
Streamlit Web Application: The project also includes a Streamlit web app to display the analysis interactively. The app allows users to explore different properties, visualize price distributions, and identify key patterns through dynamic plots and filters.
