# Real Estate Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview
This project involves analyzing real estate data to provide insights into the factors affecting property prices. The analysis focuses on different real estate sectors, including lands, apartments, and villas. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations between various factors and property prices, which can assist in making data-driven decisions in real estate investments.

## üë• Team Members
The following students contributed to this project:
- **Mushal Alshagha**
- **Yaqeen Alhalal**
- **Ahmad Alharbi**
- **Suliman Alghanmi**

## üìÇ Data Sources
The project utilizes data from multiple sources:

1. **Real Estate Data**:
    - **`realEstate.csv`**: Contains general real estate information such as property prices, area, and other attributes.
    - **`Riyadh_Aqqar.xlsx`**: Excel file with detailed data on various types of properties in Riyadh (land, apartments, villas).
    - **`RiyadhVillasAqar.csv`**: Focuses specifically on villa-related real estate data.

2. **Data Files**:
    - `realEstate.csv`: Real estate data in CSV format.
    - `Riyadh_Aqqar.xlsx`: Excel file with comprehensive property data.
    - `RiyadhVillasAqar.csv`: Data specifically about villas in Riyadh.

## üîç Analysis & Methodology
In this project, we apply various data analysis techniques to gain insights into the Riyadh real estate market:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We start by cleaning and exploring the data using libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`. This step helps us understand the data's structure and identify missing or erroneous values.
  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Using **correlation matrices**, we examine the relationships between different features (e.g., area, price, location) and property prices.
  
- **Data Visualization**: We utilize **seaborn** and **matplotlib** to create informative charts, including:
  - Bar plots
  - Heatmaps
  - Scatter plots
